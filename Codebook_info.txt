Feature Selection 
=================

The file "sum_data.txt" contains the final submission for the "Getting and 
Cleaning Data" course. 

The dataset consists of 180 rows of data with 563 columns on each row. The 
first row contains the column name for each column. 

Each row contains the average measurement for each column variable for one 
subject (listed numerically on the first column) and for one activity (listed
by name on the second column). 

The 561 features whose mean values are listed on columns 3 through 563 are
the same as on the input data, namely:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
